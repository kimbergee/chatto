## Details
Chatto is a single-page application that allows users to chat with each other in various chat rooms. The application first prompts a user to enter a username via a modal and then saves it to the browser with cookies. Once a username is set, the user can easily click to enter any rooms that they want to chat in. They can also create a new chat room if there isn't one for a topic they want to discuss.
